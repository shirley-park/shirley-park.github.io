                <h4>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h4>
                <p>
                  Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the basic building blocks of a webpage It is a text-based approach to describing how content (elements like headings, text, lists) should be displayed on a page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language that describes how HTML element should be displayed in terms of styling. Styling can include color, font, position of elements, spacing between elements, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Javascript (JS) is a language that allows content to be dynamic such as animations and any movement of elements or refreshes on the webpage.
                </p>
                 <p>
                  Think of HTML and CSS as a couple in a relationship. HTML wears the pants, CSS is the good looking one. Then they meet JS, a super-active, into extreme sports kind of person. They enter into a polyamourous relationship with JS and together they go dancing. &#128517;

              <h4>Explain control flow and loops</h4>
              <p>
                Control flow is the order in which the computer executes code. Generally, code is run from the top to bottom (first line to the last line), but this flow can be changed with conditionals and loops.<sup>1</sup>
              </p>

              <p>
                Loops allow us to repeat code based on a specified condition being true. It will continue running until this condition returns false.
              </p>

                  Think of control flow as your morning coffee routine. Your normal routine could involve: 
                  <ol>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">1. heat the water in gooseneck kettle</li>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">2. place the filter paper in your pourover filter</li>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">3. measure your coffee beans and grind them</li>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">4. wet the filter paper with the hot water</li>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">5. place the ground coffee in the filter</li>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">6. pour hot water over the coffee grounds</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                  This control flow could be interrupted with a conditional and loop:
                  <ol>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">&#9749; conditional in step 3: if we have coffee beans, measure them out and grind them, otherwise go and buy more beans (which interrupts the normal control flow).</li>

                    <li class="blog-bullets">&#9749; loop in step 6: repeat step 6 until you have filled a certain amount of your mug.</li>

                <h4>What is the DOM? and an example of how you might interact with it.</h4>
                <p>
                  The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface that contains Javascript objects that represent the content on the page (the JS representation of a webpage). It's our JS "window" or access portal into the contents of a webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The document object is the entry point into the world of the DOM. It contains representations of all the content on a page, plus a lot of useful methods and properties.
                </p>
                <p>Within the document, are various methods and properties which can be used to manipulate the document. There are methods that allow us to use JS to single out an element, or elements with a certain class </p>
