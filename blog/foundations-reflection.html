        <h5>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h5>

        <ul class="blog-bullets">
          <li>1. I'm pretty self-critical if I don't understand something on the first go</li>
          <li>2. I often compare my progress or abilities with others</li>
          <li>3. I need to keep my mindset in check</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h5>
        <p>
          Learning programming is more than developing technical skills. It involves continual debugging, trial and error and lots of fails, but this can help us realise that failure is essential to learning and lead us to develop skills like perseverence, teamwork, empathy and self-awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soft skills like empathy and self-awareness are valuable in programming as it helps us to be aware of and be sensitive to the feelings of others which is crucial when we are trying to identify problems and develop effective solutions.

      <h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>
      <p>
        It has been good to regroup and wrap up the goings on during the week. Writing the blog posts helped cement new technical concepts and also served as a weekly as check-in to reflect on the challenges from the week.

      <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>
      <p>
        I find it difficult to write about myself and share with people I haven't met, but it has been good to debrief and share my experience during foundations.

      <h5>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h5>
      <p>
        It is evident that soft skills are crucial in web development as it's all about having good interpersonal skills, self-awareness and having empathy for others which are crucial for teamwork and solving problems.

      <h5>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h5>
      <p>
        Not at all, I enjoyed having a change from the technical challenges, and the content was super helpful to set me up for the tech challenges (such as having a growth mindset and active listening).
