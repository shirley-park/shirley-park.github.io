                <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
                 <p>
                  For a long time, it was believed that the brain could not change after childhood. However neuroplasticity has proven that this is not true. While brains are more malleable in childhood, they can continue to adapt and change throughout life. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Neuroplasticity is a process that involves adaptive structural and functional changes to the brain. It is the brain's ability to change, reorganize or grow neural networks.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This can be in response to functional changes from traumatic brain injury or when exposed to learning new things.
                 </p>

              <h5>How do the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h5>
              <p>
                Neuroplasticity tells us that the brain has the lifelong capacity to change and rewire itself in response to stimulation and learning experience. The brain can create neurons and strengthen neural networks as a result from learning a new ability, environment influences, and practice. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In Carol Dweck's book <em>Mindset</em>, studies have shown that when people are taught that their brains can respond to change to develop new skills and abilities, they foster the belief that they can grow their abilites and become more engaged and motivated in their learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Allowing our brains to adapt and change helps promote:
                <ul>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- The ability to learn new things</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- enhancing existing cognitive capabilities</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- recovery from traumatic brain injuries, strengthening areas where function has declined.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </div>

                <h5>How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity</h5>
                <p>
                  I became fascinated by Neuroplasticity and the growth mindset after reading <em>Mindset</em> by Carol Dweck which subsequently led me to other great books like:
                  <ul>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">- <em>Limitless</em> by Jim Kwik.</li>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">- <em>The Genius in All of Us</em> by David Shenk.</li>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">- <em>The Brain Warrior's Way</em> by Daniel Amen and Tana Amen.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                  A common theme in these books is the idea is the importance of effort in continuous improvement and focusing on "becoming" rather than "being".
                </p>
                
              </div>
            </section>

            <div class="blog-entry">
              <p>
                After reading these books, my approach to learning new things has changed. These are a few things I've been trying these days for study and physical exercise:
                <ul>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- maintaining a postive mindset regardless</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- If something is unfamiliar, I completely accept that I'm a total noob and try to completely open my mind to absorb as much as possible</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- daily practise and repetition</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </div>

                Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can be nurtured through learning and effort, while intrinsic motivation is the volition to engage in a task for inherent satisfaction. Individuals with growth mindset believe that motivation can be nurtured, and that extrinsic motivation can be internalized
