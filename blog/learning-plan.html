                <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
                <p>
                  My long term goal is to be able to work in a multi-faceted full stack role in a team where I can continue to expand my skills and learn from more experienced developers. I would love to be in a role which is flexible, and allows me to work anywhere.

                <p>
                  I have a strong work ethic, am patient and good at managing my own time.
                  Having said that, if I don't consciously check up on myself, my work/life balance can go out the window. I'm much better at it now, but it still a work in progress.

                <p>
                  I am excited to collaborate and learn from with others to build things, and I would like to improve my communications skills which will be vital for teamwork and conflict resolution.
