        <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
        <h5>That time I was stuck on a simple problem</h5>
          <p>
            For question 3 of the Gradebook kata exercise, the task was to add a new property, testScores, to each student property in the gradebook. The value of testScores should be equal to the student&#39;s scores in the scores array.
          </p>
          <p>
            I often write out (with pen and paper) the problem and the desired result before writing out the steps in pseudocode.
          </p>
          <p>
            On pen and paper, I figured the problem could be solved by looping through the names in the students array and assigning their corresponding scores from the scores array.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of using a for loop, I wanted to use an array method as I wanted more practise on these.
          </p>
          <p>
            I googled the most suitable array method, which turned out to be forEach(). However after reading the MDN docs I couldn't get my head around how to access the index of the array (the i in the for loop).

        &#129335;&#127995;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039; For no particular reason, I thought the forEach() method could take only one parameter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#128529; So I was stuck with the code below for a while:

      <p>
        &#129292; Then i went totally down the wrong path of looking up nested for loops...
      </p>
      <p>
        &#129488; After a bit of a break I did some googling and finally found the perfect answer from freeCodeCamp:
      </p>
      <img src="../images/problem-solving-freeCodeCamp-forEach.png" alt="forEach method optional parameters" class="blog-image">

      <p>
        &#127881; Hurrah! So all I needed was an i included as a parameter in the forEach function:

        Wow &#129318;&#127995;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039; I felt super incompetent during that whole exercise, especially because the syntax was in the MDN docs I first consulted. So yea, I'm still in the phase of not fully understanding the MDN docs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kata challenges were great to practise Javascript and it provided many opportunities to get comfortable with being completely lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned to not get too frustrated and take a break away from the screen when going down a random google rabbit hole (eg, when looking up nested loops above). I relied heavily on pen and paper (my version of the rubber ducky method) to deconstruct problems, as well as psuedocode, and Googling.

    <h5>That time I (somewhat) elegantly solved a problem</h5>
    <p>
       It was super satisfying when I could solve a question:
      <ul>
        <li class="blog-bullets">a. within a few attempts</li>
        <li class="blog-bullets">b. with not many lines of code</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This didn't happen a lot &#128517;  but there was one instance of this in question 3.1 (Odds out) in Javascript Olympics where the question was to create a function that accepted an array of numbers then returned that array with only even numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granted, the question did hint to use an array method haha but it was one of the few times where I felt like I knew what I was doing, somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was able to dissect the question with a couple of lines of pseudocode and it was cool to able answer this in one line using the .filter() array method and the remainder % operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things I learned during this question:
      <ul>
        <li class="blog-bullets">1. array methods can be amazing alternatives from loops</li>
        <li class="blog-bullets">2. It's super important to fully understand the question and the outcome it is asking for in order to solve it. For other challenges, I would try to scribble down possible steps before even understanding the question in its entirety.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>A reflection on using problem-solving techniques:</h5>
      <h6>Pseudocode</h6>
      <p>
        I really like using this technique to break the problem down to smaller parts and solving each of the parts step by step rather than winging it.
      </p>
      <h6>Trying something</h6>
      <p>
        I really like the idea of this, but don't think I'm as confident to trial things yet. Mainly because I don't feel I have many the Javascript tools up my sleeve to use at my disposal (yet!). At the moment I tend to Google things first before trying anything.
      </p>
      <h6>Rubber ducky method</h6>
      <p>
        I love this method, although instead of talking to an inanimate object I tend to talk out loud with pen and paper and try to explain to myself what we're trying to solve and how we could go about it.

  <div class="blog-entry">
    <h6>Console.logging</h6>
    <p>
      I like to console.log any bit of code, large of small to see if my functions, loops, variables are doing what was intended. I like this technique as it can show specifically where i have gone wrong.
    </p>
    <h6>Reading error messages</h6>
    <p>
      I find this really useful as it often points you exactly which line in your code is causing the error.
    </p>
    <h6>Googling</h6>
    <p>
      My go to if I am stuck on syntax or methods. What's great about this is you often learn about other methods during your research.
    </p>
    <h6>Asking your peers for help</h6>
    <p>
      I didn't reach out as much as I would have liked during these kata exercises. I would be caught up trying to refer back to my pen and paper scribbling that I didn't step back and consider framing my question to others on Dischord. I see the mutual benefit of working things through with someone else and need to remind myself of this avenue.
    </p>
    <h6>Asking coaches for help</h6>
    <p>
      I am all for this because I love seeing how other people go about solving the same problem so even if I have completed an exercise, I really like to see different methods from the experienced facilitators.
    </p>
    <h6>Improving your process with reflection</h6>
    <p>
      I often do this during yoga at the end of the day. It's a good way for me to check in with myself and recollect what I learned on the day, what I struggled with, and any improvements that I can make next time.
