                <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
                 <p>
                  For a long time, it was believed that the brain could not change after childhood. However neuroplasticity has proven that this is not true. While brains are more malleable in childhood, they can continue to adapt and change throughout life. 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Neuroplasticity is a process that involves adaptive structural and functional changes to the brain. It is the brain's ability to change, reorganize or grow neural networks.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This can be in response to functional changes from traumatic brain injury or when exposed to learning new things.
                 </p>

              <h5>How do the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h5>
              <p>
                Neuroplasticity tells us that the brain has the lifelong capacity to change and rewire itself in response to stimulation and learning experience. The brain can create neurons and strengthen neural networks as a result from learning a new ability, environment influences, and practice. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In Carol Dweck's book <em>Mindset</em>, studies have shown that when people are taught that their brains can respond to change to develop new skills and abilities, they foster the belief that they can grow their abilites and become more engaged and motivated in their learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Allowing our brains to adapt and change helps promote:
                <ul>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- The ability to learn new things</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- enhancing existing cognitive capabilities</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- recovery from traumatic brain injuries, strengthening areas where function has declined.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </div>

                <h5>How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity</h5>
                <p>
                  I became fascinated by Neuroplasticity and the growth mindset after reading <em>Mindset</em> by Carol Dweck which subsequently led me to other great books like:
                  <ul>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49994260-limitless"><em>Limitless</em></a> by Jim Kwik.</li>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7012191-the-genius-in-all-of-us?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_16"><em>The Genius in All of Us</em></a> by David Shenk.</li>
                    <li class="blog-bullets">- <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29808768-the-brain-warrior-s-way?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_15"><em>The Brain Warrior's Way</em></a> by Daniel Amen and Tana Amen.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                  A common theme in these books is the idea is the importance of effort in continuous improvement and focusing on "becoming" rather than "being".
                </p>

              <p>
                After reading these books, my approach to learning new things has changed. These are a few things I've been trying these days for study and physical exercise:
                <ul>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- embracing challenges</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- maintaining a postive mindset regardless</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- If something is unfamiliar, I completely accept that I'm a total noob and try to completely open my mind to absorb as much as possible</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">- daily practise and repetition</li>
                </ul>

              <h5>Some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h5>
              <p>
                Neuroplasticity is an ongoing process throughout life as a result of learning, experience and memory formation.
              </p>
              <p>
                To foster neuroplasticity, it is important to be aware that your abilities are not fixed and can be developed.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this mindset, your possibilities to stimulate and strengthen the brain are endless. Ways to do this include:
                <ul>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">&#127931;
                    learning a new skill like a new language or musical instrument</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">&#128218;
                    reading books</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">&#127939; regular physical exercise</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">&#129744; eating well</li>
                  <li class="blog-bullets">&#128564; getting quality sleep</li>

                <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
                 <p>
                  Having a growth mindset means believing that a person's abilities are not innate but can be nurtured through learning, effort and persistence.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  A growth mindset is about the attitude a person has when they face challenge, they way they process setbacks, and how they learn, adapt and grow as a result.

              <h5>Why is having a growth mindset relevant?</h5>
              <p>
                In the pursuit of acquired new skills and abilities, it is so important to adopt this mindset. Unlike somone with a fixed mindsets, a person with a growth mindset is likely to learn by a mastery approach, embrace challenges and put in effort to learn. 
              </p>
              <p>
                They do not see their intelligence or abilities as fixed and they will mobilize their learning resources without the fear of an adverse outcome.
              </p>
              <p>
                Growth-minded people perceive setbacks as a necessary part of the learning process and they are able to rebound from failures and setbacks by increasing their motivational effort.

              <h5>My exploration of the growth mindset</h5>
              <p>
                Eduardo Briceño explains in his Ted talk (above), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN34FNbOKXc">"The Power of Belief"</a> that "from athletes to musicians to chess champions, research has shown that the greatest indicator of success is not talent, but rather, a champion&#39;s mindset".
              </p>
              <p>
                He talks about the key to success; that it is not simply effort, or focus, or resilience, but the growth mindset that creates them. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Changing careers is a nerve-wracking process, and it's easy to get into unhelpful thoughts like not being good enough and imposter syndrome while you are trying to learn something completely new. I've struggled with this negative self-talk but learning about the growth mindset has been helpful to rewire my thinking and approach to my learning.

              <h4>My learning plan and strategies</h4>
              <p>
                After researching the growth mindset and watching Eduardo Briceño's talk, I can see how adopting the mindset will help me on my journey at Dev Academy. Often, I find myself taking longer to understand some concepts but instead of undermining my abilities I need to value effort and persistence rather than seeing it as a weakness.
              </p>
              <p>
                I intend to adopt this mindset so that my focus on learning and growing. Mistakes and criticism will be abound, but I look forward to acknowledging and learning from them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally I need to dial down the negative self-talk and just enjoying the ups and downs will help me get through the course and my career transition.
