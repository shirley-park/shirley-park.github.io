            Friends and family say that I am:
            
            <ul class="blog-bullets">
              <li>&#127813; logical and analytical</li>
              <li>&#127813; open to new experiences</li>
              <li>&#127813; conscientious</li>
              <li>&#127813; goal oriented</li>
            </ul> 
          </p>
          <p>
            Limitations include: 
            <ul class="blog-bullets">
              <li>&#127786; jumping into things without much planning</li>
              <li>&#127786; If I don't understand something, I go down a Google rabbit hole to find out, which is not always productive.</li>
              <li>&#127786; I tend to try to do everything on my own and not reach out for help when I'm stuck</li>

          <h4>How your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h4>

          <p>
            My friends have family have always instilled persistence and hard work for the people and things you care about. They have also stressed the importance of continuous learning, especially through rough times.

        <h4>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

        <p>
          My first job out of uni was working as an immigration officer, which involved reviewing NZ residency applications and pushing them forward for approval. The official protocol was for residency applications to be decided on a first-come-first served basis. However some managers disregarded this process and had a tendancy to fast-track application based on the applicant's occupation (For example, people who were nurses, chefs, labourers, etc would have their applications vetoed for any missing documents whereas doctors, CEOs, etc, were given more leniency. In another instance, a manager was not a fan of lawyers, so would be more stringent towards these applicants). 
        </p>

        <p>
          This did not sit right with me, and for months it was difficult to work with these unspoken rules. I questioned this with managers who, realised that this was not a fair process and also screwed up the workflow. Fortunately, it was agreed to for everyone to let go of their bias, and treat every case equally.

            My strengths include: 
          </p>
          
          <ul class="blog-bullets">
            <li>&#9898; being organized</li>
            <li>&#9898; open to learning new things</li>
            <li>&#9898; having a logical and analytical mindset</li>
          </ul> 
          <p>
            These will help me manage my time (especially during foundations) and set up clear goals to complete the day's tasks.

            According to the <a href="https://www.viacharacter.org/survey/account/register" class="hyperlink">VIA institute Character test</a>, my strongest traits are:

              <ul class="blog-bullets">
                <li>1. Love</li>
                <li>2. Judgement</li>
                <li>3. Kindness</li>
                <li>4. Love of learning</li>
                <li>5. Humility</li>
              </ul>

            My "lesser strengths" were surprisingly accurate:
          </p>
          <ul class="blog-bullets">
                <li>1. Spirituality</li>
                <li>2. Gratitude</li>
                <li>3. Leadership</li>
          </ul> 
            <p>
              This was a useful exercise to remind myself of my character traits. It has certainly shown areas I want to work on as I enter into this new chapter of my professional life.

      <h4>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?

        I like to jump into tasks without having a plan of attack, and if I get stuck on something I have a tendency to try and sort it out on my own instead of reaching out for help.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am working on breaking these habits and am constantly checking myself as it doesn't help my progression. I am excited about collaborative aspect of Dev Academy and working towards building something with others.

      <h4>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.

        During my university exchange abroad, we were tasked to team up with 2 others to work on a presentation for the art history course. It involved talking about a specific period, noted artists from that period, characteristics of notable works, etc. The presentation held a lot of weight for the final grade and it was important that everyone in the group had to speak for a few minutes each.
      </p>

      <p>
          Being on exchange, it can be difficult to hunker down to study. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of being overseas, travelling, partying, etc. My team members were also exchange students so we were in the same boat. We planned the presentation together and split it up evenly and tried to coordinate our schedules so that we meet up from time to time and discuss our progress or any problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately one of the team members did not pull his weight and would not show up to meetings and did not complete his part of the presentation. I was difficult to get in contact with him but he would assure us that his part was "done".
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We kept on chasing him up for his part of the presentation but without success, and in the end we had to prepare his part of the presentation for him to present on the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thinking back I should have asked him about his workload, he may have had other deadlines which should have been considered when dividing the tasks, or I should have reached out to help him with his part of the work, instead of waiting on him. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally if everyone in a team communicates and understands where each other is at and why, issues like this can be avoided or be worked around together.
