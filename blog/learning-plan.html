                <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
                <p>
                    My long term goal is to be able to work in a multi-faceted full stack role in a team where I can continue to expand my skills and learn from more experienced developers. I would love to be in a role which is flexible, and allows me to work anywhere.

                <p>
                  I have a strong work ethic, am patient and good at managing my own time.
                  Having said that, if I don't consciously check up on myself, my work/life balance can go out the window. I'm much better at it now, but it still a work in progress.

                <p>
                  I am excited to collaborate and learn from with others to build things, and I would like to improve my communications skills which will be vital for teamwork and conflict resolution.

                <h4>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h4>
                <p>
                  I want to make the most of this experience and aim to stay positive throughout the programme and practise as much as I can to become comfortable with the material.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When working with others, I will be professional and respectful at all times, and also be honest and transparent with facilitators on my understanding of the course material or if there are any issues I am facing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the workloads becomes stressful, I will take time out for self care (going for a run, yoga), and to reflect and collect myself.

                <h4>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
                <p>
                 I am commited to giving my best effort on the sprints, and if I am struggling or stuck on a problem for more than 20 minutes, I will communicate any questions or problems to my Homegroup leaders and/or the other facilitators on Dischord. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  My partner is a great listener, so I will always debrief him on things I'm struggling with or anxious about. He may not understand fully of what I'm going through, so I will also reach out to the lovely folks in my Homegroup (perhaps for some more loop chats!) or through the foundations channel on Dischord.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If I need further emotional/wellbeing support (during Bootcamp), I will reach out to the Human Skills Facilitator.

                <p>
                  They have been great so far! I hope they will continue to be supportive, open to any questions without any judgement and motivate me if I start losing my marbles and burn out.

                <p>
                  Fortunately, my family and friends have been super understanding that I will be out of action for the next few months so that I can completely focus on foundations and bootcamp.
